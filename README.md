    *   Neon glowing text and borders.
    *   Futuristic typography (Share Tech Mono).

*   **Interactive Dashboard**:
    *   **System Status**: Real-time monitoring of system health, threats, and AI status.
    *   **Navigation Panel**: Access to different modules like Dashboard, Object Detection, and Cyber Attack.
    *   **Console Output**: Simulated terminal executing commands and showing system logs.

*   **Advanced Visualizations**:
    *   **Object Detection**: Simulated camera interface with object detection overlays.
    *   **Neural Network**: Visual representation of neural network activity.
    *   **Quantum Computing**: Abstract visualization of quantum processing.
    *   **Data Charts**: Dynamic charts showing system metrics.

*   **Simulated Functionality**:
    *   **Security Alerts**: Interactive security breach alerts with "Neutralize" and "Lockdown" options.
    *   **Hacking Modules**: Interactive grid of "hacking" tools.
